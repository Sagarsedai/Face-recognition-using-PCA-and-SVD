# Face-recognition-using-PCA-and-SVD
Human beings can detect and recognize faces skillfully even when conditions like face expression, lighting condition, or viewing angle change. In this paper, we describe a procedure for facial recognition using PCA and SVD after explaining both concepts thoroughly. To validate our theoretical results, we develop a facial recognition application that are efficient even under the change of the mentioned conditions using linear dimensionality reduction techniques. We've also found that the dimensionality reduction technique used in face recognition can be used for image compression and this is also validated in the results.
